# DiscordRoleManager
> Manage Discord Roles the lazzyyy way


## Installation

- Create a new discord Bot -> [GUIDE](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)
- Invite the Bot to your Discord Server
	- Check the boxes for the needed permissions
	- Minimum requirements: manage roles and send messages
	- Manage roles, it will only be able to manage roles that are below his role/permissions
	- Enable PRESENCE INTENT, SERVER MEMBERS INTENT and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
	- Use the URL that page generates and go to it, and you will be asked to log into your discord. You will need Admin access in order to get the bot to join that server.
- Rename config.json.example to config.json
- Edit config.json and fill out the required infos.
- Create a Mysql Database
- If you used DiscordRoleManager before, backup your dataBase.sqlite 
- update to latest master 
- copy your dataBase.sqlite file back. The Bot will migrate all users from sqlite to mysql.

Even if you have this bot only on a single discord server you have to set the guild ID and register the bot.

As a Workaround to use the multiguild feature and not to crash the bot please manually set the guild_id for all users in the db.
(This will be fixed later after I figured out how to)

```update temporary_roles set guild_id = YOURGUILDID where guild_id is null;```

For the first run please register the bot with
```
(prefix)register
```
After that please register the Admin and Moderator Role with
```
(prefix)register adminrole @AdminRole
(prefix)register modrole @ModRole
(prefix)register channel #mainchannelforthebotinformation
```

```sh
#Please remove all comments as this is currently not handled by the bot!
